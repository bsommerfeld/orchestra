# Persistence Module Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Analyzed Domain Model**
   - Examined Symphony, Choir, and Voice classes to understand their structure and relationships
   - Identified key properties and relationships that need to be persisted

2. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Added Jackson for JSON processing
   - Added MapStruct for object mapping
   - Added validation libraries

3. **Created DTO Layer**
   - Implemented VoiceDTO, ChoirDTO, and SymphonyDTO classes
   - Designed DTOs for JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Added proper validation annotations

4. **Implemented Mapper Layer**
   - Created generic Mapper interface
   - Implemented VoiceMapper, ChoirMapper, and SymphonyMapper interfaces and implementations
   - Handled recursive relationships between entities

5. **Developed Repository Layer**
   - Created generic Repository interface
   - Implemented SymphonyRepository interface
   - Created JsonSymphonyRepository implementation for JSON-based storage

6. **Built Service Layer**
   - Designed SymphonyService interface with business operations
   - Implemented SymphonyServiceImpl with validation and error handling
   - Added methods for working with nested entities (Choirs and Voices)

7. **Updated Dependency Injection**
   - Configured bindings in OrchestraModule for all persistence components
   - Ensured proper injection of dependencies

8. **Created Documentation**
   - Documented the architecture and design principles
   - Provided usage examples
   - Described extension points for future development

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for mappers to verify correct conversion between domain models and DTOs
   - Unit tests for repositories to verify correct storage and retrieval
   - Unit tests for services to verify business logic
   - Integration tests to verify the entire persistence flow

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add more specific exception types
   - Improve error messages
   - Add logging

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add caching for frequently accessed entities
   - Optimize JSON serialization/deserialization

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add encryption for sensitive data
   - Implement access control

## Next Steps

The immediate next step should be to implement unit tests for the persistence module to ensure it works correctly. This should include:

1. Creating test classes for each mapper, repository, and service
2. Writing test cases for all public methods
3. Using a test framework like JUnit
4. Setting up a test environment with mock dependencies

After testing, the module can be integrated with the UI layer to provide a complete task management application.
